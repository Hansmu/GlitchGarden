To consider different aspect ratios you could stretch, add black bars or croppign edges. We'll go with cropping, quiet zones are areas that could be cut without losing the meaning.
Screen match mode: Matching on height or width puts in bars on changing ratios. With shrink it crops the edges for the ratio. Select it from the Canvas.
Use expand when you don't have quiet zones.

When building for mobile, .mp3 musics are better than .oggs, because ogg doesn't work on iOS.

Create prefabs when you have repeatable elements. For example buttons.

To fade in a screen add a UI -> Panel.

Playerprefs. They are persistent storage on the machine. This is unencrypted storage. A hacker could unlock it. It's slow to access, slow to access it on a frame by frame basis.
Limitations of playerprefs: slow to read and write, max file size 1MB, only supports Float, Int, String.
Write a wrapper for it to know for certain what keys we have, add error handling etc. Makes it safer.

Animation
Sprite sheets are frames of an animation.Bone based animation is having bits of the body apart and then moving those arounda  pivot point. Working out the grids for
Unity's slice. Grid width = image width / columns. Grid height = image height / rows.

Making a 2D animation
Create an empty GameObject
Drag one of the sprites as a placeholder
Add an Animator
Go into Animation window
Create new clip

Screen math ratio
Example 4:3
That means you have 4 units of measurement in one way and 3 the other.
If you want a screen to get smaller with the same ratio, for example 11, then you'd multiply with the smaller fraction ex. 11 * 3/4.
If you want a screen to get bigger with the same ratio, for exmaple 11, then you'd multiply with the bigger fraction ex. 11 * 4/3.
If you'd have a screen with the height of 4cm, then to get the width on a 16:9 screen, you'd do 4cm * 16 / 9 = 64 / 9 = 7 cm
